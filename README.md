` SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals `
The function is written to extract, process, analyze and present data provided in a javascript object using the tools that we learned in class.

Programming Language used: JavaScript

For the project, I utilized the following tools:
1. loops (almost exclusively for loops, for in and for of)
2. if...else conditionals
3. arrow functions
4. JavaScript methods

`Reflection (Optional)` `
1. What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?`

I followed the advice given by our instructor and brokedown the project into smaller questions and steps. I wrote the steps on my notebook and drew the datasets to see the relationships among them. Though, I found this to be extremely helpful, I felt that I took a lot of time coming up with code solutions for each question and re-working them. I appreciate the recurssive steps that I took as they helped me learn; and I hope to be more proficient with more exercise and increase my velocity. 

2. Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

I do not think that the requirements were difficult. The instructions on the written material could be a bit more clear; understanding them might have proven difficult had we not received additional clarification from our instructor.

3. What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

Oh! I would have applied (and loved to do so) a lot more of the really cool tools and techniques that we learned in class.

4. Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
i. I loved the warm up exercises that we did in class. I will continue to look for such exercises and keep on practicing to make myself more proficient in JS
ii. I will try to find ways of applying each new technique that we learn about in my lab  or personal project.
